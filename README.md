## How to run the app

### Using docker compose

Go to the project root directory and run:

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

App should be running on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

On the index page you can run the tests for the selected task.

I didnt used a testing framework, instead I just run the provided test cases in a test class.
